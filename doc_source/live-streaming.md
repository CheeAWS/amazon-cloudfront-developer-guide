# Delivering Live Streaming Video with CloudFront and AWS Media Services<a name="live-streaming"></a>

To use AWS Media Services with CloudFront to deliver live content to a global audience, follow the guidance included in this section\.

[AWS Elemental MediaLive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/medialive/latest/ug/getting-started.html) encodes live video streams in real time\. If you have a larger\-sized live video source—for example, video coming from a ground encoder like Elemental Live—you can compress it by using MediaLive into smaller versions \("encodes"\) that are then distributed to your viewers\.

There are two main options for preparing and serving live streaming content:
+ **Convert your content into required formats, and then serve it:** You can use [AWS Elemental MediaPackage](https://aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/) to convert your video content from a single format to multiple formats, and then package the content for different device types\. MediaPackage lets you implement video features for viewers such as start\-over, pause, rewind, and so on\. MediaPackage can also protect your content from unauthorized copying by adding Digital Rights Management \(DRM\)\. For step\-by\-step instructions for using CloudFront to serve content that was formatted using MediaPackage, see [Serving Live Video Formatted with AWS Elemental MediaPackage](#live-streaming-with-mediapackage) in this topic\.
+ **Store and serve your content using scalable origin:** If your encoder already outputs content in the formats required by all of the devices that your viewers use, you can serve the content by using a highly\-scalable origin like an [AWS Elemental MediaStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/getting-started.html) container\. For step\-by\-step instructions for using CloudFront to serve content that is stored in a MediaStore container, see [Serving Video Using AWS Elemental MediaStore as the Origin](#video-streaming-mediastore) in this topic\.

After you've set up your origin by using one of these options, you can distribute live streaming video to viewers by using CloudFront\.

**Tip**  
You can learn about an AWS solution that automatically deploys services for building a highly\-available real\-time viewing experience\. To see the steps to automatically deploy this solution, see [Live Streaming Automated Deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/live-streaming/deployment.html)\.

## Serving Video Using AWS Elemental MediaStore as the Origin<a name="video-streaming-mediastore"></a>

If you have video stored in an [AWS Elemental MediaStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/getting-started.html) container, you can create a CloudFront distribution to serve the content\.

To get started, you grant CloudFront access to your MediaStore container\. Then you create a CloudFront distribution and configure it to work with MediaStore\.

1. Follow the procedure at [ Allowing Amazon CloudFront to Access Your MediaStore Container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/cdns-allowing-cloudfront-to-access-mediastore.html), and then return to these steps to create your distribution\.

1. Create a distribution with the following settings:  
Origin Domain Name  
The data endpoint that is assigned to your MediaStore container\. From the dropdown list, choose the MediaStore container for your live video\. The format of a MediaStore origin is Container\-OriginEndpointURL\. For example, mymediastore\.data\.mediastore\.us\-east\-1\.amazonaws\.com\. For more information, see [Origin Domain Name](distribution-web-values-specify.md#DownloadDistValuesDomainName)\.  
Origin Path  
The folder structure in the MediaStore container where your objects are stored\. For more information, see [Origin Path](distribution-web-values-specify.md#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath)\.  
Origin Custom Headers  
Add header names and values if you want CloudFront to include custom headers when it forwards requests to your origin\.  
Viewer Protocol Policy  
Choose **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**\. For more information, see [Viewer Protocol Policy](distribution-web-values-specify.md#DownloadDistValuesViewerProtocolPolicy)\.   
Object Caching  
If the transcoder that you use can't set cache controls on all objects, choose **Customize**\. If your transcoder can set cache controls on all objects, choose **Origin Cache Headers**\.   
Minimum TTL, Maximum TTL, and Default TTL  
Set as appropriate for your caching needs and segment durations\.  
Error Caching Minimum TTL  
Set to 5 seconds or less, to help prevent serving stale content\.

   For the other settings, you can set specific values based on other technical requirements or the needs of your business\. For a list of all the options for web distributions and information about setting them, see [Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution](distribution-web-values-specify.md)\.

1. After you create your distribution and it’s been provisioned, edit the cache behavior to set up cross\-origin resource sharing \(CORS\) for your origin:

   1. Select the distribution, and then choose **Distribution Settings**\.

   1. Choose **Behaviors**, select your origin, and then choose **Edit**\.

   1. Under **Cache Based on Selected Request Headers**, choose **Whitelist**, and then, under **Whitelist Headers**, select **Origin**\.

   To learn more about CORS, see *Configuring CloudFront to Respect Cross\-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\) Settings* in [Caching Content Based on Request Headers](header-caching.md)\.

1. For links in your application \(for example, a media player\), specify the name of the media file in the same format that you use for other objects that you're distributing using CloudFront\.

## Serving Live Video Formatted with AWS Elemental MediaPackage<a name="live-streaming-with-mediapackage"></a>

If you’ve used AWS Elemental MediaPackage to format a live stream for viewing, you can create a CloudFront distribution and configure cache behaviors to serve the live stream\. The following process assumes that you have already [ created a channel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/ug/channels-create.html) and [added endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/ug/channels-add-endpoint.html) for your live video using MediaPackage\.

**Note**  
Instead of using the following process, you can choose to automatically create a CloudFront distribution when you save a channel in MediaPackage\. For more information, see [Creating a Distribution from AWS Elemental MediaPackage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/ug/cdns-cf.html#cdns-create-mp) in the *AWS Elemental MediaPackage User Guide*\.

To create a CloudFront distribution for MediaPackage manually, follow these steps:

**Topics**
+ [Step 1: Create and configure a CloudFront distribution](#live-streaming-with-mediapackage-create-dist)
+ [Step 2: Add the other endpoints as origins](#live-streaming-with-mediapackage-add-endpoints)
+ [Step 3: Configure cache behaviors for all endpoints](#live-streaming-with-mediapackage-create-cache-behavior)
+ [Step 4: Use CloudFront to serve the live stream channel](#live-streaming-with-mediapackage-serve-channel)

### Step 1: Create and configure a CloudFront distribution<a name="live-streaming-with-mediapackage-create-dist"></a>

Complete the following procedure to set up a CloudFront distribution for the live video channel that you created with MediaPackage\.<a name="live-streaming-with-mediapackage-create-dist-procedure"></a>

**To create a distribution for your live video channel**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudfront/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)\.

1. Choose **Create Distribution**\.

1. On the **Select a delivery method for your content** page, in the **Web** section, choose **Get Started**\.

1. Choose the settings for the distribution, including the following:  
**Origin Domain Name**  
The origin where your MediaPackage live video channel and endpoints are\. Choose the text field, then from the dropdown list, choose the MediaPackage channel for your live video\. You can map one channel to several origin endpoints\.  
If you created your channel using another AWS account, type the origin URL value into the field\. The origin must be an HTTPS URL\.  
For more information, see [Origin Domain Name](distribution-web-values-specify.md#DownloadDistValuesDomainName) in the [Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution](distribution-web-values-specify.md)\.  
**Origin Path**  
The folder structure in the MediaPackage where your objects are stored\. When you choose a channel from the dropdown list, the path is filled in for you\.  
Note that if you chose to use a channel from another AWS account for **Origin Domain Name**, the **Origin Path** field is not filled in for you\. You must get the correct origin path from the other account so that you can enter it manually\.  
For more information about how an origin path works, see [Origin Path](distribution-web-values-specify.md#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath) in [Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution](distribution-web-values-specify.md)\.

   For the other distribution settings, set specific values based on other technical requirements or the needs of your business\. For a list of all the options for distributions and information about setting them, see [Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution](distribution-web-values-specify.md)\.

   When you finish choosing the other distribution settings, choose **Create Distribution**\.

1. Choose the distribution that you just created, then choose the **Behaviors** tab\.

1. Choose the default cache behavior, and specify the correct cache behavior settings for the channel that you chose for the origin\. Later, you’ll add one or more additional origins and edit cache behavior settings for them\.

1. Go to the [**CloudFront Distributions** page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home#distributions:)\.

1. Wait until the value of the **Status** column for your distribution has changed from **In Progress** to **Deployed**, indicating that CloudFront has created your distribution\.

### Step 2: Add the other endpoints as origins<a name="live-streaming-with-mediapackage-add-endpoints"></a>

Repeat the steps here to add each of your MediaPackage channel endpoints to your distribution\.<a name="live-streaming-with-mediapackage-add-endpoints-procedure"></a>

**To add other endpoints as origins**

1. On the CloudFront console, choose the distribution that you created for your channel\.

1. Choose the **Origins and Origin Groups** tab, then choose **Create Origin**\.

1. For **Origin Domain Name**, in the dropdown list, choose a MediaPackage endpoint for your channel\. The **Origin Path** field will be automatically filled in for you\.

1. For the other settings, set the values based on other technical requirements or the needs of your business\. For more information, see [Origin Settings](distribution-web-values-specify.md#DownloadDistValuesOrigin) in [Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution](distribution-web-values-specify.md)\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

### Step 3: Configure cache behaviors for all endpoints<a name="live-streaming-with-mediapackage-create-cache-behavior"></a>

For each endpoint, you must configure cache behaviors to add path patterns that route requests correctly\. The path patterns that you specify depend on the video format that you’re serving\. The following procedure includes the path pattern information to use for HLS, CMAF, DASH, and Microsoft Smooth Streaming formats\.

You typically set up two cache behaviors for each endpoint:
+ The parent manifest, which is the index to your files\.
+ The segments, which are the files of the video content\.<a name="live-streaming-with-mediapackage-create-cache-behavior-procedure"></a>

**To create a cache behavior for an endpoint**
**Note**  
For all endpoint formats except for a Microsoft Smooth Streaming endpoint, you must repeat the steps, to add two cache behaviors\.

1. On the CloudFront console, choose the distribution that you created for your channel\.

1. Choose the **Behaviors** tab, then choose **Create Behavior**\.

1. In the **Cache Behavior Settings** section, for **Path Pattern**, type the first path pattern for the endpoint type for this origin, using the following path pattern guidance\. For example, if it’s a DASH endpoint, type `*.mpd` for **Path Pattern**\.  
**Path Patterns**  
For an HLS endpoint, create the following two cache behaviors:  
   + A cache behavior with a path pattern of `*.m3u8` \(for the parent and child manifests\)
   + A cache behavior with a path pattern of `*.ts` \(for the segments\)
For a CMAF endpoint, create the following two cache behaviors:  
   + A cache behavior with a path pattern of `*.m3u8` \(for the parent and child manifests\)
   + A cache behavior with a path pattern of `*.mp4` \(for the segments\)
For a DASH endpoint, create the following two cache behaviors:  
   + A cache behavior with a path pattern of `*.mpd` \(for the parent manifest\)
   + A cache behavior with a path pattern of `*.mp4` \(for the segments\)
For a Microsoft Smooth Streaming endpoint, only a manifest is served, so you create only one cache behavior:  
   + A cache behavior with a path pattern of `index.ism/*`

1. Specify values for the following settings, for each cache behavior:  
**Viewer Protocol Policy**  
Choose **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**\.  
**Cache Based on Selected Request Headers**  
Choose **None \(improves caching\)**\.  
For more information about improving caching, see [Increasing the Proportion of Requests that Are Served from CloudFront Edge Caches \(Cache Hit Ratio\)](cache-hit-ratio.md)\.  
**Object Caching**  
MediaPackage sets default `Cache-Control` headers that ensure correct playback behavior\. If you want to use those values, choose **Use Origin Cache Headers**\. However, you can increase cache times for video segments\. For more information about customizing the time that objects stay in the CloudFront cache, see [Object Caching](distribution-web-values-specify.md#DownloadDistValuesObjectCaching) in the [Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution](distribution-web-values-specify.md)\.  
**Minimum TTL**  
Set to 5 seconds or less, to help prevent serving stale content\.  
**Query String Forwarding and Caching**  
Choose **Forward all, cache based on whitelist**\.  
**Query String Whitelist**  
Specify `m` as the query string parameter that you want CloudFront to use as the basis for caching\. The MediaPackage response always includes the tag `?m=###` to capture the modified time of the endpoint\. If content is already cached with a different value for this tag, CloudFront requests a new manifest instead of serving the cached version\.  
If you’re using the time\-shifted viewing functionality in MediaPackage, specify `start` and `end` as additional query string parameters on the cache behavior for manifest requests \(`*.m3u8`, `*.mpd`, and `index.ism/*`\)\. This way, content is served that’s specific to the requested time period in the manifest request\. For more information about time\-shifted viewing and formatting content start and end request parameters, see [ Time\-shifted Viewing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/ug/time-shifted.html) in the *AWS Elemental MediaPackage User Guide*\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

1. If your endpoint is not a Microsoft Smooth Streaming endpoint, choose **Create Behavior**, and then repeat these steps to create a second cache behavior\.

### Step 4: Use CloudFront to serve the live stream channel<a name="live-streaming-with-mediapackage-serve-channel"></a>

After you create the distribution, add the origins, and create the cache behaviors, you can serve the live stream channel using CloudFront\. Content requests from viewers are routed to the correct MediaPackage endpoints based on the settings that you configured for the cache behaviors\.

For links in your application \(for example, a media player\), specify the URL for the media file in the standard format for CloudFront URLs\. For more information, see [Customizing the URL Format for Files in CloudFront](LinkFormat.md)\.
